# Hofstadter Hamiltonian

This repository contains the code for generating Holfstarder's Butterfly.

### Codes and their purpose.

- **Hofstadter-Hamiltonian.cpp** - Main code for generating the Holfstarder Butterfly. The figure is generated using the algorithm given in an article by D. Hofstadter, "Energy levels and wave functions of Bloch electrons in rational and irrational magnetic fields (1976)". The program is written in C++, and the figure is generated using GNUplot after the excecution is completed.
