# Hofstadter Hamiltonian

This repository contains the code for generating Holfstarder's Butterfly.

### Codes and their purpose.

- **Hofstadter-Hamiltonian.cpp** - Main code for generating the Holfstarder Butterfly. The figure is generated using the algorithm given in an article by D. Hofstadter, "Energy levels and wave functions of Bloch electrons in rational and irrational magnetic fields (1976)". The program is written in C++, and the figure is generated using GNUplot after the excecution is completed.

#### Author has no responsibility over the code, even for fitness. So run the code at your own risk.
